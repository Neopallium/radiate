1.) implement different way to:
    * Which members of the popoulation survive each generation?
        - Top from every species (current way of doing things)
        - Top # from the entire popoulation
        - only the best
        - species with greatest imrovement generation over generation
        ??
    * how to pick parents
        - biased random from specific species (current way)
        - only the survivers, whoever they are (above)
        - only the best in each species allowed to reproduce
        - pick one parent from one species then in another pick the one which is the most differnt (probably a large increase in compute time)

2.) LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) neurons for NEAT

3.) CTRNN (Continuous Time Recurrent Neural Network) neurons for NEAT

4.) Would need to slightly edit or alter population controls (can still leave current options as default to prevent breaking builds)
